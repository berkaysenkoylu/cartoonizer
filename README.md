Image cartoonizer app: [CARTOONIZER](https://berkaysenkoylu.github.io/cartoonizer/)

Backend: Python (Flask, deployed on heroku)
Frontend: React
CSS Preprocessor: Sass

Note: On heroku, apps tend to go asleep if there is no traffic in 1 hour. So, first POST request may take 10-20 secs, other than that, it works relatively fast depending on the image quality.
